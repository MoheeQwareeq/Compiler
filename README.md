# Compiler

That's a great project idea writing a simple compiler can be a challeng but highly educational experience,A compiler typically consists of several stages, starting from a sequence of characters and ending with machine code generation,These stages include a Scanner, Parser, Semantic Checker, and Code Generator.

This project provides a unique opportunity to explore various concepts, such as variable scoping techniques in different programming languages when implemented in a symbol table. It also allows for an understanding of different call routines, such as call by reference and call by value. Additionally, it enables the definition of different types of errors that can be detected by the compiler and types that cannot be detected, such as runtime errors.
